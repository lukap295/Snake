<h2>Introduction</h2>

Welcome to the Snake Game project! This classic Snake Game is implemented in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). It was created as part of a college assignment to demonstrate programming skills and knowledge of game development concepts.




The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game continues until the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.



<h4>-Simple and intuitive controls</h4>

<h4>-Randomly generated food to keep the game interesting</h4>
